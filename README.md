# combinecontrol-public
 
This repository contains the open-source release of some of [TacoNBanana](https://www.taconbanana.com/)'s Garry's Mod roleplay gamemodes. These gamemodes are based on [combinecontrol](https://github.com/disseminate/combinecontrol) by disseminate and have been in active development in one form or the other for the better part of \~8+ years

Included is a snapshot of the code as it was at the time of release, minus any cleaning up of things like SteamID's, sensitive data and other snippets that we would prefer to keep to ourselves.

For more information including a brief setup guide and FAQ, check out the [wiki](../../wiki).

ZRP is the name of the script that was used between 2018 and 2020 for a number of different smaller settings, including multiple zombie roleplay scenarios and random roleplay scenarios. It is essentially a cut down version of the TRP2 script.
