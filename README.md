# combinecontrol-public
 
This repository contains the open-source release of some of [TacoNBanana](https://www.taconbanana.com/)'s Garry's Mod roleplay gamemodes. These gamemodes are based on [combinecontrol](https://github.com/disseminate/combinecontrol) by disseminate and have been in active development in one form or the other for the better part of \~8+ years

Included is a snapshot of the code as it was at the time of release, minus any cleaning up of things like SteamID's, sensitive data and other snippets that we would prefer to keep to ourselves.

For more information including a brief setup guide and FAQ, check out the [wiki](../../wiki).

TRP2 is the name used to describe our Terminator Roleplay server and script that was active in the period of 2018-2020, the script was scavenged from Tekka (An original cyberpunk setting that was abandoned at the time) and reworked into what you see here.
